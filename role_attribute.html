<!-- The role attribute in HTML is used to define the purpose of an HTML 
element and convey the semantic meaning of an element to assistive technologies such as screen readers.
It helps to provide a clear, meaningful structure to the web page and makes it easier for
users who rely on assistive technologies to understand and interact with the content.

Here's an example of the role attribute in action: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Role Attribute Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- A header element with the role of banner -->
    <header role="banner">
      <h1>Header</h1>
    </header>
    <br><br>
    
    <!-- A navigation element with the role of navigation -->
    <nav role="navigation">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <br><br>
    
    <!-- A main content element with the role of main -->
    <main role="main">
      <h1>Main Content</h1>
      <p>This is the main content of the web page.</p>
    </main>
    <br><br>
    
    <!-- A search form element with the role of search -->
    <form role="search">
      <label for="search-field">Search:</label>
      <input type="text" id="search-field">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    <br><br>
    
    <!-- A footer element with the role of contentinfo -->
    <footer role="contentinfo">
      <p>Footer</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, the role attribute is used to specify the purpose of each element on the web page, such as a header with the role of "banner", a main content section with the role of "main", and a search form with the role of "search". This information can be used by assistive technologies to provide a clear, meaningful structure to the web page and help users to understand and interact with the content. -->
